Spresense is a compact development board based on Sony’s power-efficient
multicore microcontroller CXD5602. It allows developers to create IoT
applications in a very short time and is supported by the Arduino IDE as well
as the more advanced NuttX based SDK.

- Integrated GPS
  The embedded GNSS with support for GPS, QZSS and GLONASS enables applications
  where tracking is required.
- Hi-res audio output and multi mic inputs
  Advanced 192kHz/24 bit audio codec and amplifier for audio output, and
  support for up to 8 mic input channels.
- Multicore microcontroller
  Spresense is powered by Sony's CXD5602 microcontroller (ARM® Cortex®-M4F × 6
  cores), with a clock speed of 156 MHz.
